## Overview

This repository presents a **Customer Behavior Analytics** project developed by Gabriel Demetrios Lafis. The goal is to demonstrate the application of data science techniques to understand purchasing patterns, segment customers, and predict churn, using Python and R for analysis and visualization.

Project features include:

*   **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Deep understanding of customer data.
*   **Customer Segmentation**: Using clustering algorithms (K-Means) to identify groups of customers with similar behaviors.
*   **RFM Analysis (Recency, Frequency, Monetary)**: A powerful technique to segment customers based on their transaction history.
*   **Churn Prediction**: Building Machine Learning models to predict which customers are most likely to leave the service.
*   **Interactive Visualizations**: Dashboards created with Plotly to dynamically explore insights.
*   **Bilingual Documentation**: Comprehensive READMEs in Portuguese and English.

## How to Use

### Prerequisites

Ensure you have Python 3.9+ and R 4.1+ installed on your system. Python dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt`.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/galafis/Customer-Behavior-Analytics.git
    cd Customer-Behavior-Analytics
    ```

2.  **Install Python dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3.  **Install R dependencies (if using R scripts):**

    Open the R console and run:

    ```R
    install.packages(c("dplyr", "ggplot2", "cluster", "factoextra", "corrplot", "randomForest", "caret", "plotly", "DT", "shiny", "shinydashboard"), repos="http://cran.us.r-project.org")
    ```

### Execution

#### Python Analysis

To run the customer behavior analysis in Python and generate the HTML dashboard:

```bash
python src/customer_analytics.py
```

The interactive dashboard will be saved as `customer_behavior_dashboard.html` in the project root.

#### R Analysis

To run the customer behavior analysis in R:

```bash
Rscript src/customer_analysis.R
```

Or interactively in the R console:

```R
source("src/customer_analysis.R")
results <- run_customer_analysis()
```

## Tests

To run the Python unit tests:

```bash
export PYTHONPATH=$PYTHONPATH:$(pwd)
python -m unittest tests/test_customer_analytics.py
```

## GitHub Pages

An interactive demo of the dashboard generated by the Python script is available via GitHub Pages [here](https://galafis.github.io/Customer-Behavior-Analytics/).
